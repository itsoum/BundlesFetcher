description: 'Quantum is a virtual network service for Openstack, and a part of

  Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically

  request and configure virtual servers, Quantum provides an API to

  dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks

  connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs

  from Nova VMs). The Quantum API supports extensions to provide

  advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,

  etc.).

  .

  This charm should be deployed alongside nova-compute services to

  allow quantum to manage virtual networking across compute nodes.
