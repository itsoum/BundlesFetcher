description: 'GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several peta-

  bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or

  TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system.

  GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file system in terms of

  features and extensibility. It borrows a powerful concept called

  Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS is in

  userspace and easily manageable.  This package installs init scripts

  and configuration files to turn GlusterFS into a fully fledged file

  server.
