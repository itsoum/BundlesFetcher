description: 'This charm deploys a puppet master, which is the server hosting

  manifests and files for the puppet nodes.  Puppet lets you centrally

  manage every important aspect of your system using a cross-platform

  specification language that manages all the separate elements normally

  aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts, along

  with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.

  Puppet''s simple declarative specification language provides powerful

  classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while

  allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency

  and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
