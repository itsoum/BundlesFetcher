description: 'pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the

  chroot. It is an ideal system to use to check that a package has

  correct build-dependencies. It uses apt extensively, and a local

  mirror, or a fast connection to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not

  necessary.  "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot

  image.  "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of

  testing/unstable/whatever  "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and

  builds a binary in the chroot image.  pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian

  Developers, to allow running pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal

  user.
