description: 'distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across

  several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same

  results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often

  significantly faster than a local compile.  distcc does not require

  all machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to

  have the same libraries or header files installed.
