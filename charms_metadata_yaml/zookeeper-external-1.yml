description: 'ZooKeeper is a centralized, reliable, service for maintaining

  configuration information, naming, providing distributed

  synchronization, and group services. All of these kinds of services

  are used in some form or another by distributed applications.  This

  package contains the shell scripts and an example configuration but

  does not automatically start up the service. The example configuration

  is installed with the update-alternatives mechanism.
