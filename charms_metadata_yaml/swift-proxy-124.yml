description: 'OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software
  for

  creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized

  servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or

  real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a

  more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and

  then updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this

  type of storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email

  storage and backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of

  control provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.

  .

  This charm deploys the Swift proxy service, providing HTTP based access

  onto underlying Swift storage services.
