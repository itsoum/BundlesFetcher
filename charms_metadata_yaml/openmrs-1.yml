description: "OpenMRS is a software platform and a reference application which enables\
  \ \ndesign of a customized medical records system with no programming knowledge\
  \ \n(although medical and systems analysis knowledge is required). It is a \ncommon\
  \ platform upon which medical informatics efforts in developing \ncountries can\
  \ be built. The system is based on a conceptual database \nstructure which is not\
  \ dependent on the actual types of medical information \nrequired to be collected\
  \ or on particular data collection forms and so can \nbe customized for different\
  \ uses.\n"
