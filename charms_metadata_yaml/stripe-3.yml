description: 'This is a template to use with Django-rainbow called a stripe. Edit
  the config.yaml files settings with your Django project settings

  and add a relationship to the django-rainbow carm. If you will be using more than
  one stripe than the entire charm needs

  to be copied and renamed. This will create two stripes with two different Django
  project settings contained therein. You can re-deploy

  the project by simply adding the relationship back to django rainbow. To update
  the project code on the server,

  simply re-add the relation back to django-rainbow.
