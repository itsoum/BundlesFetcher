description: 'GlusterFS is an open source, distributed file system capable of scaling

  to several petabytes (actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands

  of clients. GlusterFS clusters together storage building blocks over

  Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect, aggregating disk and memory

  resources and managing data in a single global namespace. GlusterFS

  is based on a stackable user space design and can deliver exceptional

  performance for diverse workloads.
