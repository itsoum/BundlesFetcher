description: "SPECjbb2005 (Java Server Benchmark) is SPEC's benchmark for evaluating\
  \ the\nperformance of server side Java. Like its predecessor, SPECjbb2000,\nSPECjbb2005\
  \ evaluates the performance of server side Java by emulating a\nthree-tier client/server\
  \ system (with emphasis on the middle tier). The\nbenchmark exercises the implementations\
  \ of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine),\nJIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, garbage collection,\
  \ threads and some aspects of\nthe operating system. It also measures the performance\
  \ of CPUs, caches,\nmemory hierarchy and the scalability of shared memory processors\
  \ (SMPs).\nSPECjbb2005 provides a new enhanced workload, implemented in a more\n\
  object-oriented manner to reflect how real-world applications are designed\nand\
  \ introduces new features such as XML processing and BigDecimal\ncomputations to\
  \ make the benchmark a more realistic reflection of today's\napplications. \n"
