description: 'The OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox is
  a free, open source CFD software package developed by OpenCFD Ltd at ESI Group and
  distributed by the OpenFOAM Foundation. It has a large user base across most areas
  of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM
  has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving
  chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics.
  It includes tools for meshing, and for pre- and post-processing. Almost everything
  runs in parallel as standard, enabling users to take full advantage of computer
  hardware at their disposal.

  By being open, OpenFOAM offers users complete freedom to customise and extend its
  existing functionality, either by themselves or through support from OpenCFD. It
  follows a highly modular code design in which collections of functionality (e.g.
  numerical methods, meshing, physical models, etc.) are each compiled into their
  own shared library. OpenFOAM includes over 80 solver applications that simulate
  specific problems in engineering mechanics and over 170 utility applications that
  perform pre- and post-processing tasks, e.g. meshing, data visualisation, etc.

  The user sets a case according to the usual file structure and organization of OpenFOAM
  cases. The decomposeParDict dictionary that provides case decomposition information
  must be located in the case/system directory. Its correct settings of equal distribution
  to all listed cores are automatically written by the charm. Solver information are
  read from the main controlDict dictionary, also located in the case/system directory.
  The charm executes the necessary applications in a correct order, including pre-processing,
  case decomposition, solver run, and case reconstruction. The post-processing can
  then be performed by user with a paraFoam application.
