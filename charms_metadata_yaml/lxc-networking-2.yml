description: 'This Charm configures the unit so LXC containers are bridged directly
  to the given network, allowing them to dhcp the network the host is connected to
  for ip adresses.


  This is achieved by creating the lxcbr0 interface and configuring it to connect
  directly to the interface of the given network. Default LXC containers are connected
  to this bridge; connecting them to the eth0 interface.
