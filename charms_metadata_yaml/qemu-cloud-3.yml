description: 'This will start a QEMU instance running Ubuntu. Currently this charm
  uses the

  ARM/highbank model running Ubuntu 12.04 armhf, but could be expanded for

  other models in the future. A host port will be forwarded to the ssh port of

  the QEMU instance. Note: this service models a 4G system, so a memory

  constraint of >= 5G is recommended (deploy --constraints mem=5G).
