description: 'Kubernetes is an open-source platform for deplying, scaling, and operations

  of appliation containers across a cluster of hosts. Kubernetes is portable

  in that it works with public, private, and hybrid clouds. Extensible through

  a pluggable infrastructure. Self healing in that it will automatically

  restart and place containers on healthy nodes if a node ever goes away.
