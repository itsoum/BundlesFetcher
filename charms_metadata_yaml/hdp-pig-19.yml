description: "Apache\u2122 Pig allows you to write complex MapReduce transformations\
  \ using a \nsimple scripting language. Pig Latin (the language) defines a set of\
  \ \ntransformations on a data set such as aggregate, join and sort.  \nPig translates\
  \ the Pig Latin script into MapReduce so that it can be executed\nwithin Hadoop\xAE\
  . Pig Latin is sometimes extended using UDFs \n(User Defined Functions), which the\
  \ user can write in Java or a scripting \nlanguage and then call directly from the\
  \ Pig Latin\n"
