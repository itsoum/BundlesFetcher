description: 'Gunicorn or Green Unicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It''s
  a

  pre-fork worker model ported from Ruby''s Unicorn project. The Gunicorn server

  is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on

  server resources, and fairly speedy.


  The providers of the wsgi relation must provide working_dir, plus optionally

  any of the charm''s config directives, which will override the current config

  for the charm.
