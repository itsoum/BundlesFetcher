description: 'PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.

  It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven

  architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability,

  data integrity, and correctness. It is fully ACID compliant, has full

  support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures

  (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including

  INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP.

  It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures,

  sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java,

  .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional

  documentation (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/).
