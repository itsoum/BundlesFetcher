description: "Rsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility\n\
  providing support for message logging), with features that include:\n\n* reliable\
  \ syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP\n* on-demand disk buffering\n* email alerting\n\
  * writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)\n* permitted\
  \ sender lists\n* filtering on any part of the syslog message\n* on-the-wire message\
  \ compression\n* fine-grained output format control\n* failover to backup destinations\n\
  * enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying\n\nThis is a simple rsyslogd logging\
  \ server. It is most interesting\nwhen paired with the rsyslog-forwarder subordinate\
  \ charm. \n"
