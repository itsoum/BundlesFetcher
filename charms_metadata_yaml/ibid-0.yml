description: 'Ibid is a multi-protocol general purpose chat bot written in Python.
  It

  uses a natural language interface, and can connect to multiple sources,

  including IRC, Jabber and SILC servers, as well as allowing interaction

  using SMTP, HTTP and various RPC protocols. It aims to be agnostic with

  regard to how it is used, and to make plugins and extensions as easy as

  possible to write.
