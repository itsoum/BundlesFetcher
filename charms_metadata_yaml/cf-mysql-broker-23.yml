description: 'CF MySQL Broker provides MySQL databases as a Cloud Foundry service.

  This broker demonstrates the v2 services API between cloud controllers and service
  brokers.

  The broker does not include a MySQL server. Instead, it is meant to be deployed
  alongside a MySQL server, which it manages.
