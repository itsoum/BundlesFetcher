description: 'John the Ripper is a tool designed to help systems administrators to

  find weak (easy to guess or crack through brute force) passwords, and

  even automatically mail users warning them about it, if it is desired.

  Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on

  various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are Kerberos AFS and

  Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hashes, plus several more with contributed

  patches.
