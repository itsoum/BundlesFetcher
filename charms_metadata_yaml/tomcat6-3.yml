description: 'Apache Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP)

  specifications from Sun Microsystems, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP

  web server environment for Java code to run.  This package contains

  only the startup scripts for the system-wide daemon. No documentation

  or web applications are included here, please install the tomcat6-docs

  and tomcat6-examples packages if you want them. Install the authbind

  package if you need to use Tomcat on ports 1-1023. Install

  tomcat6-user instead of this package if you don''t want Tomcat to start

  as a service.
