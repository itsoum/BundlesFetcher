description: 'Varnish Cache is a state of the art web accelerator written with

  performance and flexibility in mind.  Varnish Cache stores web pages

  in memory so web servers don''t have to create the same web page over

  and over again. Varnish serves pages much faster than any application

  server; giving the website a significant speed up.  Some of the

  features include: * A modern design * VCL - a very flexible

  configuration language * Load balancing with health checking of

  backends * Partial support for ESI - Edge Side Includes * URL

  rewriting * Graceful handling of "dead" backends
