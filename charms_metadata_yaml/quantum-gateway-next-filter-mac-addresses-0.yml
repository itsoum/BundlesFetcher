description: 'Neutron is a virtual network service for Openstack, and a part of

  Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically

  request and configure virtual servers, Neutron provides an API to

  dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks

  connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs

  from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide

  advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,

  etc.)

  .

  This charm provides central Neutron networking services as part

  of a Neutron based Openstack deployment
