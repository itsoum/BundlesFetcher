description: 'Rsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility

  providing support for message logging), with features that include:


  * reliable syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP

  * on-demand disk buffering

  * email alerting

  * writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)

  * permitted sender lists

  * filtering on any part of the syslog message

  * on-the-wire message compression

  * fine-grained output format control

  * failover to backup destinations

  * enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying


  This is a simple rsyslogd logging server. It is most interesting

  when paired with the rsyslog-forwarder subordinate charm.
