description: 'Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and run applications
  that process vast amounts of data.

  This charm manages a dedicated client node as a place to run Hadoop-related jobs.  However,
  its main purpose is to serve as a base layer for other client charms, such as Spark
  or Zeppelin.
