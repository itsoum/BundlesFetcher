description: 'Postfix is Wietse Venema''s mail transport agent that started life as
  an

  alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.  Postfix attempts to

  be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being

  sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the

  outside has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely

  different.
