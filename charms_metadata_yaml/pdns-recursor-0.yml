description: 'PowerDNS is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number of

  different backends ranging from simple zonefiles to relational

  databases and load balancing/failover algorithms. PowerDNS tries to

  emphasize speed and security.  This is the recursive nameserver that

  goes out to the internet and resolve queries about other domains.


  Be careful when configuring this to restrict queries to allowed hosts,

  as open DNS recursors are a popular repeater for distributed denial of

  service attacks.
