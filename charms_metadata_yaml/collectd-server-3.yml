description: 'collectd is a small daemon which collects system information

  periodically and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values

  in a variety of ways. Since the daemon doesn''t need to startup every

  time it wants to update the values it''s very fast and easy on the

  system. Also, the statistics are very fine grained since the files are

  updated every 10 seconds by default.  The collected information can be

  used to find current performance bottlenecks (performance analysis)

  and predict future system load (capacity planning).  This package

  provides a full installation of the daemon, including the

  configuration. For the core system, see the "collectd-core" package,

  which allows sites to, e.g., provide customizations (like a custom

  default configuration) on top of it without having to modify the

  "collectd" package.
