description: 'Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs

  of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while

  still maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.

  This package contains the daemon for the nodes being monitored.  You

  should install it on all the nodes in your network. It will know how

  to extract all sorts of data from the node it runs on, and will wait

  for the gatherer to request this data for further processing.  It

  includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such

  as cpu usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your

  own plugins which are capable of extracting other system-specific

  values is very easy, and is often done in a matter of minutes. You can

  also create plugins which relay information from other devices in your

  network that can''t run Munin, such as a switch or a server running

  another operating system, by using SNMP or similar technology.  Munin

  is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker''s excellent

  RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a

  link from <http://munin.projects.linpro.no/> to a live installation.
