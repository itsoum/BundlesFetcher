description: 'Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the

  dataset is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support

  for atomically manipulating and querying data structures such as lists

  and sets.  The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically

  flushed to disk.

  This charm supports data replication and provides both the master and the

  slave services.
