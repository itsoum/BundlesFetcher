description: 'Ceilometer aims to deliver a Single Point Of Contact for billing systems,

  providing all the counters they need to establish customer billing, across

  all current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be

  traceable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new

  projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the

  overall system.

  .

  Aodh provides the Alarming service as part of OpenStack telemetry.
