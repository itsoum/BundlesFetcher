description: 'Data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop

  .

  Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that

  provides tools to enable easy data summarization, adhoc querying and

  analysis of large datasets data stored in Hadoop files. It provides a

  mechanism to put structure on this data and it also provides a simple

  query language called Hive QL which is based on SQL and which enables

  users familiar with SQL to query this data. At the same time, this

  language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to be able to

  plug in their custom mappers and reducers to do more sophisticated

  analysis which may not be supported by the built-in capabilities of

  the language.
