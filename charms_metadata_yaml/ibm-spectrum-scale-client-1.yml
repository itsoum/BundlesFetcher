description: "Spectrum Scale provides simplified data management and integrated information\
  \ lifecycle tools capable of managing petabytes of data and billions \nof files,\
  \ in order to arrest the growing cost of managing ever growing amounts of data.\n\
  A Spectrum Scale client node is any server that has the Spectrum Scale product installed\
  \ but do not support direct attached disks. \nAlso a client node will not be part\
  \ of the node pool from which file system managers and token managers can be selected.\n"
