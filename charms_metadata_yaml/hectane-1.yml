description: 'Hectane is an open-source SMTP client designed to simplify the process
  of

  delivering emails from a web application. Messages are delivered to the

  daemon through an HTTP API and then queued for eventual delivery. Messages

  awaiting delivery are stored on disk to avoid data loss.
