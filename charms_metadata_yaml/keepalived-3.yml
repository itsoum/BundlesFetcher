description: 'keepalived is used for monitoring real servers within a Linux Virtual

  Server (LVS) cluster.  keepalived can be configured to remove real

  servers from the cluster pool if it stops responding, as well as send

  a notification email to make the admin aware of the service failure.

  In addition, keepalived implements an independent Virtual Router

  Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2; see rfc2338 for additional info)

  framework for director failover.
