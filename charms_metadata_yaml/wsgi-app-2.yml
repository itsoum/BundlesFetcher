description: 'This charm should be able to serve most simple WSGI applications.

  It can hook into postgresql or mongodb databases (whose locations

  will be available to the app as DATABASE_URL and MONGO_URL environment

  variables), provides HTTP interfaces for load-balancing, and you can

  pass any extra environment variables for your application

  through the environment_variables config option.
