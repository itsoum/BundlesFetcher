description: 'diaspora*, the privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all,

  open source social network, is a decentralized social network

  that puts you in control of you own data. When you set up a

  personal pod, all your data is stored in that pod. You maintain

  ownership of everything you share on diaspora*, giving you full

  control over how it''s distributed.
