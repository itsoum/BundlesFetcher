description: "Fast\nA single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads\
  \ and writes per \nsecond from thousands of clients.\n\nCurrently deploys Apache\
  \ Kafka 2.9.2-0.8.2.1\n\nScalable\nKafka is designed to allow a single cluster to\
  \ serve as the central data \nbackbone for a large organization. It can be elastically\
  \ and transparently \nexpanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and\
  \ spread over a \ncluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability\
  \ of any \nsingle machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers\n\nDurable\n\
  Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent \ndata\
  \ loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages without performance \nimpact.\n\
  \nDistributed by Design\nKafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers strong\
  \ durability and \nfault-tolerance guarantees.\n"
