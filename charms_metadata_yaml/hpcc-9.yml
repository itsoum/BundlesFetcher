description: "HPCC Systems, an open source High Performance Computing Cluster, is\
  \ a massive parallel-processing computing \nplatform that solves Big Data problems.\
  \ HPCC Systems is an enterprise-proven platform for manipulating, \ntransforming,\
  \ querying, and data warehousing Big Data. Built by LexisNexis, the HPCC platform\
  \ has helped \nit grow to a $1.5 billion information solutions company.\n.\nThe\
  \ HPCC Systems architecture incorporates a data query engine (called Thor) and a\
  \ rapid data delivery \nengine (called Roxie), as well as support components. An\
  \ HPCC environment can include only Thor clusters, \nor both Thor and Roxie clusters.\
  \ The HPCC Juju charm creates a cluster which contains both, but you can \ncustomize\
  \ it after deployment.\n.\nThe HPCC Juju Charm encapsulates best practice configurations\
  \ for the HPCC Systems Platform. \nYou can use a Juju Charm to stand up an HPCC\
  \ Platform on:\n.\n* Local Provider (LXC)\n* Amazon Web Services Cloud\n"
