description: 'DokuWiki is a wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.

  It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It

  has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain

  readable outside the wiki and eases the creation of structured texts.

  All data is stored in plain text files -- no database is required.
