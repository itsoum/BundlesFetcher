description: "OpenDJ is the only 100 percent open-source big data platform that combines\
  \ the security of a proven directory with the accessibility of a database. Lightweight\
  \ and easy to embed, it allows you to easily share real-time identity data across\
  \ enterprise, cloud, social and mobile environments - a practical necessity for\
  \ managing today identity relationship management challenges (IRM). \nWith OpenDJ,\
  \ you no longer need to be an LDAP expert; choose either LDAP or REST to access\
  \ identity data using a single solution that can replicate data across on and off-premise\
  \ applications.\n- See more at: http://forgerock.com/products/open-identity-stack/opendj\n"
