description: 'A modular interface on top of Salt that can provide a variety of entry

  points into a running Salt system. It can start and manage multiple

  interfaces allowing a REST API to coexist with XMLRPC or even a

  Websocket API.  The Salt API system is used to expose the fundamental

  aspects of Salt control to external sources. salt-api acts as the

  bridge between Salt itself and REST, Websockets, etc.
