description: 'Virtual Accelerator provides low latency and high networking throughput

  while offloading the virtual switching from the Openstack hypervisor

  networking stack (Neutron).

  The CPU resources necessary for packet processing are drastically reduced, so that

  less cores are required to process network traffic at higher rates.

  It allows a better determinism for your performances.


  Virtual Accelerator is fully integrated with Linux and its environment, so

  that your existing Linux networking scenario does not need to be modified to

  benefit from packet processing acceleration. For instance, you can still

  use Linux bridges, OVS, iptables or IPsec and you still benefit from networking

  acceleration for your VMs.
