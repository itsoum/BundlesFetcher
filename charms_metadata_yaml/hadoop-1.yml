description: "Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and\nrun applications\
  \ that process vast amounts of data.\n.\nHere's what makes Hadoop especially useful:\n\
  .\n* Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.\n* Economical: It\
  \ distributes the data and processing across clusters\n  of commonly available computers.\
  \ These clusters can number\n  into the thousands of nodes.\n* Efficient: By distributing\
  \ the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel\n  on the nodes where the data is\
  \ located. This makes it\n  extremely rapid.\n* Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains\
  \ multiple copies of data and\n  automatically redeploys computing tasks based on\
  \ failures.\n.\nHadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System\
  \ (HDFS).\nMapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates\n\
  multiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute\nnodes\
  \ around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is\nlocated.\n"
