description: 'SPIP is a publishing system for the Internet in which great importance

  is attached to collaborative working, to multilingual environments,

  and to simplicity of use for web authors.  SPIP''s benefit consists in:

  * managing a magazine type site i.e. made up mainly of   articles and

  news items inserted in an arborescence   of sections nested in each

  others. * completely separating and distributing three kinds of tasks

  over various players: the graphic design, the site editorial   input

  through the submission of articles and news items and   the site

  editorial management. * spare the webmaster and all the participants

  to the life of   the site, a number of tedious aspects of web

  publishing as   well as the need to learn lengthy technical skills.

  SPIP allows you to start creating your sections and   articles

  straight away.
