description: 'Cacti is a complete frontend to rrdtool, it stores all of the necessary

  information to create graphs and populates them with data in a MySQL

  database.  The frontend is completely PHP driven.  Along with being

  able to maintain Graphs, Data Sources, and Round Robin Archives in a

  database, cacti handles the data gathering also.  There is also SNMP

  support for those used to creating traffic graphs with MRTG.  This

  package requires a functional MySQL database server on either the

  installation host or remotely accessible system.  If you do not

  already have a database server available, you should also install

  mysql-server.
