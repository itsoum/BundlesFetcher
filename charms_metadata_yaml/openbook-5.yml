description: 'Openbook by Talligent is cloud management software that simplifies the
  tasks of planning, charging, and predicting capacity requirements for cloud services.
  Talligent gives the administrator and tenant real-time visibility of resources and
  accrued costs, as well as the ability to scale up or down according to budget and
  resource requirements. The Openbook Billing Engine offers a sophisticated cloud
  billing platform, with granular rate plans for various personas of tenants and usage
  patterns, supporting billing, chargeback or showback for private or public clouds.
  Resellers experience the same range of flexibility as the root cloud owner. Invoice
  and cost accounting information can easily be shared with CRM and accounting packages
  via Rest-based APIs.
