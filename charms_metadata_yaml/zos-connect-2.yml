  \ z/OS subsystems.\n\nDelivers RESTful APIs as a discoverable, first-class resource\
  \ with Swagger 2.0 descriptions \nthat are ready for consumption by application\
  \ developers, and for integration\nwith API management solutions.\n\nProvides intuitive\
  \ tooling that enables a developer with or without z/OS-skills to create \nRESTful\
  \ APIs from traditional z/OS-based assets.\n\nIncludes a new API package artifact\
  \ that encapsulates the RESTful API, together with necessary \ndetail to invoke\
  \ underlying services in the z/OS subsystems.\n\nSupports standard JSON message\
  \ format with translation to and from the required native \nformat of z/OS subsystems.\n\
