description: 'This package provides a client to update dynamic IP addresses with

  several dynamic DNS service providers, such as DynDNS.com.  This makes

  it possible to use a fixed hostname (such as myhost.dyndns.org) to

  access a machine with a dynamic IP address.  This client supports both

  dynamic and (near) static services, as  well as MX record and

  alternative name management. It caches the address, and only attempts

  the update when it has changed.
