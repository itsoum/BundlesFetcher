description: 'LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary

  Link-Layer protocols such as Extreme''s EDP (Extreme Discovery

  Protocol) and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). The goal of LLDP is to

  provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer

  notifications to adjacent network devices.  This implementation

  provides LLDP sending and reception, supports VLAN and includes an

  SNMP subagent that can interface to an SNMP agent through AgentX

  protocol.  This daemon is also able to deal with CDP, SONMP, FDP and

  EDP protocol. It also handles LLDP-MED extension.
