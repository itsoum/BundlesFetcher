description: 'BlocksCAD is a drag-and-drop 3D Computer Aided Design and modeling tool

  designed for use by elementary-age children. It is simple enough to

  learn in a few short hours of instruction, but still has the features,

  flexibility, and power of a professional-level program. It was developed

  at Einstein''s Workshop, a hands-on learning center and kids makerspace

  in the Boston area.
