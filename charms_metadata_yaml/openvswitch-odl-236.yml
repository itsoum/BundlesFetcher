description: Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer, software-based, Ethernet
  virtual switch. It is designed to enable massive network automation through programmatic
  extension, while still supporting standard management interfaces and protocols (e.g.
  NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In addition, it is designed
  to support distribution across multiple physical servers similar to VMware's vNetwork
  distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus 1000V. . OpenDaylight is a network virtualization
  solution that provides an overlay virtual-network to virtual-machines, containers
  or network namespaces. . This charm integrates Open vSwitch into OpenDayLight as
  part of an OpenStack Cloud.
