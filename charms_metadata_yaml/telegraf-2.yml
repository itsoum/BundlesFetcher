description: "It is part of the TICK stack and is a plugin-driven server agent for\
  \ collecting and reporting metrics.\nTelegraf has plugins or integrations to source\
  \ a variety of metrics directly from the system it\u2019s running on, pull metrics\
  \ from third-party APIs, or even listen for metrics via a StatsD and Kafka consumer\
  \ services.\nIt also has output plugins to send metrics to a variety of other datastores,\
  \ services, and message queues, including InfluxDB, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Datadog,\
  \ Librato, Kafka, MQTT, NSQ, and many others.\n"
