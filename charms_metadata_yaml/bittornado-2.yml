description: 'BitTornado is a bittorrent client built on the original BitTorrent

  client from BitTorrent Inc.


  This client features a console and curses mode, lots of features, and is   one of
  the original bittorrent clients created.


  Features include:

  * upload/download speed limitation

  * prioritised downloading when downloading batches (several files)

  * detailed information about connections to other peers

  * encryption (PE/MSE) support (with the recommended python-crypto)

  * console mode for running from scripts

  * curses mode for running interactively

  * tracker for the distribution of files


  This charm installs the bittornado package without GUI.

  It is primarily intended for running a headless tracker and/or seeder

  in a cloud environment.
