description: 'GNU Cobol, and a few web space applications. Some

  new and some old, thin wrapped in COBOL web.

  This is strictly a proof of concept charm.

  Production deployments will require customizations.

  This sample: loads a fresh gnu-cobol-2.1,

  downloads and compiles an OCCSide cobweb,

  and prepares the web space. gnucobol-sample is a

  mishmash of experimental COBOL.  cobweb will

  be refined. The web index provides links to

  COBOL sources. Dirt simple moving legacy COBOL

  to the web.  The plugin architecture is

  intriguing, the COBOL CALL verb providing most

  of the engine, for free.
