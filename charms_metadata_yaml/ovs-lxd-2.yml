description: 'This fires up lxd compute nodes linked by an openvswitch tunnel.

  Each node sets up openvswitch, all are linked to the master''s node

  (allowing all to communicate) and the master runs dnsmasq on it.

  The default lxc.conf is updated to hook containers to the ovs bridge.

  The master node is set up as an authorized lxd client for all other

  nodes.
