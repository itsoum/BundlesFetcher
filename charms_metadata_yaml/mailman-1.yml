description: 'The GNU Mailing List Manager, which manages email discussion lists much

  like Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman

  gives each mailing list a web page, and allows users to subscribe,

  unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can administer

  his or her list entirely from the web.  Mailman also integrates most

  things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail

  <-> news gateways, and so on.  It has all of the features you expect

  from such a product, plus integrated support for the web (including

  web based archiving), automated bounce handling and integrated spam

  prevention.
