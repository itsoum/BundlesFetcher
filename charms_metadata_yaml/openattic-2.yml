description: "openATTIC is a full-fledged central storage management system. Hardware\
  \ resources can be managed, logical storage areas can be shared and distributed\
  \ and data can be stored more efficiently and less expensively than ever before\
  \ \u2013 and you can control everything from a central management interface. It\
  \ is no longer necessary to be intimately familiar with the inner workings of the\
  \ individual storage tools. Any task can be carried out by either using openATTIC\u2018\
  s intuitive web interface or via the REST API.\n"
