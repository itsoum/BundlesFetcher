description: 'Telegraf is an agent written in Go for collecting metrics from the system
  it''s running on, or from other services, and writing them into InfluxDB or other
  outputs. Design goals are to have a minimal memory footprint with a plugin system
  so that developers in the community can easily add support for collecting metrics
  from well known services (like Hadoop, Postgres, or Redis) and third party APIs
  (like Mailchimp, AWS CloudWatch, or Google Analytics). New input and output plugins
  are designed to be easy to contribute, we''ll eagerly accept pull requests and will
  manage the set of plugins that Telegraf supports. See the contributing guide for
  instructions on writing new plugins.
