description: The main goal of this charm is to generate the necessary configuration
  for use in the Keystone charm related to Service Provider config generation, trust
  establishment between a remote idP and SP via certificates and signaling Keystone
  service restart. Keystone has a concept of a federated backend which serves multiple
  purposes including being a backend part of a Service Provider in an authentication
  scenario where SAML is used. Unless ECP is used on a keystone client side, SAML-related
  exchange is performed in an Apache authentication module (Mellon in case of this
  charm) and SAML assertions are converted to WSGI environment variables passed down
  to a particular mod_wsgi interpreter running Keystone code. Keystone has an authentication
  plug-in called "mapped" which does the rest of the work of resolving symbolic attributes
  and using them in mappings defined by an operator or validating the existence of
  referenced IDs.
