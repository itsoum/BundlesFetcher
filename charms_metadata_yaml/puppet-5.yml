description: 'This charm deploys the startup script and compatbility scripts for

  the puppet agent, which is the process responsible for configuring the

  local node.  Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect

  of your system using a cross-platform specification language that

  manages all the separate elements normally aggregated in different

  files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete

  elements like packages, services, and files.  Puppet''s simple

  declarative specification language provides powerful classing

  abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while

  allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles

  dependency and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and

  explicitly.
