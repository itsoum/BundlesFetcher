description: "What Zend Server Does:\n- Helps developers write better code and solve\
  \ issues long before their code reaches production (\u2018Left Shifting\u2019).\n\
  - Automates all steps in the release of PHP applications, from code to production,\
  \ including provisioning, versioning and rollback.\n- Optimizes performance through\
  \ dynamic scaling, code acceleration, code and data caching, job queuing and more.\n\
  - Helps to detect and fix production issues in applications, faster and with less\
  \ disruption.\n- See README for how to deploy. Use the regular Apache htdocs for\
  \ basic PHP usage. Log into the Zend Server gui at http://<Server_IP>:10081/ZendServer\
  \ for advanced usage.\n"
