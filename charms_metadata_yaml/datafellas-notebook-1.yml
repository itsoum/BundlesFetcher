description: 'Originally forked from the amazing scala-notebook,

  almost entirely refactored for Massive Dataset Analysis using Apache Spark.


  The tool allows performing reproducible analysis with Scala, Apache Spark and more.


  This is achieved through an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala
  code,

  SQL queries, Markup or even JavaScript in a collaborative manner.


  The Spark is available out of the box, and is simply accessed by the variable sparkContext.
