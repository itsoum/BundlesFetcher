description: "Installs and configures an nfs4 daemon with\nthe standard accompanying\
  \ services, portmapd\nand idmapd.\n\nTo use this, client services must implement\n\
  hooks for a storage relation that is compatible\nwith the 'mount' interface \n(\
  \ 'http://juju.ubuntu.com/Interfaces/mount' ).\n\nExported shares get created as\
  \ new services\nare joined.  \n\nFor now, service units with the same servicename\n\
  share the same exported filesystem.\n"
