description: 'Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the

  dataset is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support

  for atomically manipulating and querying data structures such as lists

  and sets.  The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically

  flushed to disk.
