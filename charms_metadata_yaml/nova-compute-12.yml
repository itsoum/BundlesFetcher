description: 'OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller.
  In

  addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon

  EC2 API.

  .

  This charm provides the Nova Compute hypervisor service and should be deployed

  directly to physical servers.
