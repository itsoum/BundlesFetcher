  \ indices and snapshots, including:\n  - Add or remove indices from an alias\n \
  \ - Shard routing allocation\n  - Disabling Bloom filter caches (for versions of\
  \ Elasticsearch < 1.4)\n  - Close indices\n  - Delete indices and snapshots\n  -\
  \ Open closed indices\n  - Optimize indices\n  - Change the number of replicas per\
  \ shard for indices\n  - Show indices and snapshots\n  - Take a snapshot (backup)\
  \ of indices. \n"
