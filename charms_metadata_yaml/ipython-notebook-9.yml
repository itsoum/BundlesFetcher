description: 'IPython can be used as a replacement for the standard Python shell,
  or

  it can be used as a complete working environment for scientific

  computing (like Matlab or Mathematica) when paired with the standard

  Python scientific and numerical tools. It supports dynamic object

  introspections, numbered input/output prompts, a macro system, session

  logging, session restoring, complete system shell access, verbose and

  colored traceback reports, auto-parentheses, auto-quoting, and is

  embeddable in other Python programs.  This package contains the basic

  terminal shell. For the qt console install ipython-qtconsole and for

  the html notebook install ipython-notebook.
