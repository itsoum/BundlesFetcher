description: 'Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against

  traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal

  freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and

  state security.


  This charm publishes Juju services as Tor hidden services.


  This instance of Tor does not operate as a relay, to avoid leaking

  information that could reveal the location of the hidden service, see

  https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en#three.
