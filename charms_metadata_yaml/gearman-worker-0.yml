description: 'Gearman is a system to farm out work to other machines, dispatching

  function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do

  work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, or to call

  functions between languages.  This package contains some command line

  tools for manipulating gearman jobs.
