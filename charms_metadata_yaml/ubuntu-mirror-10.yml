description: 'This charm deploys a full Ubuntu mirror syncing from the main archives.

  It can be configured to sync cdimages, ports and other sync components as

  well.

  It uses a storage suboordinate charm to point ot the actual storage where

  the bits will be stored.

  Be aware that a full mirror is SEVERAL TERRABYTES large! Make sure you have

  enough disk space!
