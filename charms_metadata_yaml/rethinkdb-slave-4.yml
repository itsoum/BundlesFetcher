description: "RethinkDB is the first open-source, scalable JSON database built from\
  \ the\nground up for the realtime web. It inverts the traditional database\narchitecture\
  \ by exposing an exciting new access model \u2013 instead of polling\nfor changes,\
  \ the developer can tell RethinkDB to continuously push updated\nquery results to\
  \ applications in realtime. RethinkDB\u2019s realtime push\narchitecture dramatically\
  \ reduces the time and effort necessary to build\nscalable realtime apps.\n\nIn\
  \ addition to being designed from the ground up for realtime apps, RethinkDB\noffers\
  \ a flexible query language, intuitive operations and monitoring APIs,\nand is easy\
  \ to setup and learn.\n\nThis charm provides HA support.\n"
