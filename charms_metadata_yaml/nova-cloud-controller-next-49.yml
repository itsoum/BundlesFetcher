description: 'OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce

  the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public

  and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement

  and massively scalable.

  .

  OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In

  addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon

  EC2 API.

  .

  This charm provides the cloud controller service for OpenStack Nova and includes

  nova-scheduler, nova-api and nova-conductor services.
