description: 'OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce

  the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public

  and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement

  and massively scalable.

  .

  OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In

  addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon

  EC2 API.

  .

  Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many

  different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends

  (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user

  databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.

  .

  This is the package you will install on your storage nodes.
