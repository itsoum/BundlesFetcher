description: "CFSSL is CloudFlare's PKI/TLS swiss army knife. It is both a command\
  \ line tool\nand an HTTP API server for signing, verifying, and bundling TLS certificates.\n\
  CFSSL consists of:\n - a set of packages useful for building custom TLS PKI tools\n\
  \ - the cfssl program, which is the canonical command line utility using the CFSSL\
  \ packages.\n - the multirootca program, which is a certificate authority server\
  \ that can use multiple signing keys.\n - the mkbundle program is used to build\
  \ certificate pool bundles.\n - the cfssljson program, which takes the JSON output\
  \ from the cfssl and multirootca\n   programs and writes certificates, keys, CSRs,\
  \ and bundles to disk.\n"
