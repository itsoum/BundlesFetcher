description: 'Quobyte is a distributed file system that turns commodity servers into
  a unified software storage system. As a genuine data center file system it supports
  high-performance workloads ranging from Big Data to VMs. It is completely fault-tolerant
  and massively scalable.

  .

  Quobyte simplifies the design, deployment, and management of storage infrastructures
  of any size.

  .

  The Metadata service stores Volume replicas; a Volume is usually replicated across
  three Metadata services. The Metadata service implements all POSIX calls relevant
  for metadata management, e.g. open, stat, readdir, rename, chmod, chown, etc.
