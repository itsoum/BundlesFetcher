description: 'Ceilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements

  within OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect

  the same data. It''s primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the

  framework should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that

  effect, Ceilometer should be able to share collected data with a variety of

  consumers.

  .

  This charm should be used in conjunction with the ceilometer and nova-compute

  charms to collect OpenStack measurements.
