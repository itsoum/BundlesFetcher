description: 'Graphite consists of a storage backend and a web-based visualization

  frontend. Client applications send streams of numeric time-series

  data to the Graphite backend (called carbon), where it gets stored

  in fixed-size database files similar in design to RRD. The web

  frontend provides 2 distinct user interfaces for visualizing this

  data in graphs as well as a simple URL-based API for direct graph

  generation.  Graphite''s design is focussed on providing simple

  interfaces (both to users and applications), real-time

  visualization, high-availability, and enterprise scalability.
