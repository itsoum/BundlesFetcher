description: 'Samhain is an integrity checker and host intrusion detection system
  that

  can be used on single hosts as well as large, UNIX-based networks. It

  supports central monitoring as well as powerful (and new) stealth

  features to run undetected on memory using steganography.  Main

  features    * Complete integrity check         + uses cryptographic

  checksums of files to detect           modifications,         + can

  find rogue SUID executables anywhere on disk, and    * Centralized

  monitoring         + native support for logging to a central server

  via encrypted           and authenticated connections    * Tamper

  resistance         + database and configuration files can be signed

  + logfile entries and e-mail reports are signed         + support for
