description: "The CakePHP framework provides a robust base for your application. It\
  \ can \nhandle every aspect, from the user's initial request all the way to the\
  \ final\nrendering of a web page. And since the framework follows the principles\
  \ of \nMVC, it allows you to easily customize and extend most aspects of your \n\
  application.\n\nThe framework also provides a basic organizational structure, from\
  \ filenames \nto database table names, keeping your entire application consistent\
  \ and \nlogical. This concept is simple but powerful. Follow the conventions and\
  \ \nyou'll always know exactly where things are and how they're organized.\n"
