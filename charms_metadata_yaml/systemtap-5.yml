  Systemtap allows you harness both static and dynamic instrumentation without

  recompiling your code. It can perform simple things like dynamically inserting

  a printk anywhere, or changing a critical data structure of the kernel (guru mode).

  While Systemtap has many safeguards in place to sandbox dangerous, system crashing

  actions, it''s not infallible. Proceed at your own risk.
