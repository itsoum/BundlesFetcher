description: 'PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management

  system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed

  to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:

  ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,

  triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion

  concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many

  programming languages are available as well.
