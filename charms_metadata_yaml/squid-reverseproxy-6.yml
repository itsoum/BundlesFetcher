description: "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting\
  \ FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.  Squid version 3 is a major rewrite of Squid\
  \ in C++ and introduces a number of new features including ICAP and ESI support.\n\
  Requires the following relation settings from consuming services:\n\n  ip: service\
  \ ip address\n  port: service port\n  sitenames: space-delimited list of list of\
  \ vhosts provided\n\nAlthough squid can be configured as a traditional forward proxy,\
  \ this charm supports only a reverse proxy configuration.\n"
