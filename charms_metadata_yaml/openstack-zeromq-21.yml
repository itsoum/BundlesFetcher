description: 'The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which

  extends the standard socket interfaces with features

  traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware

  products. 0MQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous

  message queues, multiple messaging patterns, message

  filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple

  transport protocols and more.

  .

  This charm enables broker-less messaging using 0MQ to the

  OpenStack charms.
