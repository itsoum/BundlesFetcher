description: memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are
  designed to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
  are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs of the
  specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl apps to avoid
  storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share this burden across several
  machines.
