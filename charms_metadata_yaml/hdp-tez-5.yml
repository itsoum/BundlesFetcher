description: "Apache\u2122 Tez is an extensible framework for building YARN based,\
  \ high performance batch and interactive data processing applications in Hadoop\
  \ that need to handle TB to PB scale datasets. It allows projects in the Hadoop\
  \ ecosystem, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, as well as 3rd-party software vendors\
  \ to express fit-to-purpose data processing applications in a way that meets their\
  \ unique demands for fast response times and extreme throughput at petabyte scale.\n"
