description: 'This package is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used
  to

  administer servers in a fast and efficient way.  It allows commands to

  be executed across large groups of servers. This means systems can be

  easily managed, but data can also be easily gathered. Quick

  introspection into running systems becomes a reality.  Remote

  execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote

  system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the Salt state system

  uses Salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in.

  Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt

  addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.  This

  particular package provides the Salt controller.
