description: "collectd is a small daemon which collects system information\nperiodically\
  \ and provides mechanisms to monitor and store the values\nin a variety of ways.\
  \ Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every\ntime it wants to update the values\
  \ it's very fast and easy on the \nsystem. Also, the statistics are very fine grained\
  \ since the files are \nupdated every 10 seconds by default.  The collected information\
  \ can be\nused to find current performance bottlenecks (performance analysis)\n\
  and predict future system load (capacity planning).\n"
