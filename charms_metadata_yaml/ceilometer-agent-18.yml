description: "Ceilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements\
  \ \nwithin OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect \n\
  the same data. It's primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the \nframework\
  \ should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that \neffect, Ceilometer\
  \ should be able to share collected data with a variety of consumers.\n.\nThis charm\
  \ should be used in conjunction with the ceilometer and nova charm to collect \n\
  Openstack measures.\n"
