description: 'Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against

  traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal

  freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and

  state security.


  This charm deploys a Tor bridge, which helps nodes connect to Tor from a

  more restricted network environment.
