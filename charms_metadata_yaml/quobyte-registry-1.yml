description: 'Quobyte is a distributed file system that turns commodity servers into
  a unified software storage system. As a genuine data center file system it supports
  high-performance workloads ranging from Big Data to VMs. It is completely fault-tolerant
  and massively scalable.

  .

  Quobyte simplifies the design, deployment, and management of storage infrastructures
  of any size.

  .

  The Registry service is at the top of the Quobyte service hierarchy. During normal
  operation, most services and clients talk to the Registry service to synchronize
  their time and lookup identifiers that are not in their caches yet.

  The registry is usually replicated across three registry service instances.
