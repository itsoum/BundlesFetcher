description: 'Run juju inside of juju.


  This is a charm to install and manage a juju client.  Use this

  to run the juju cli against environments passed as config.


  As a subordinate, this can enable a juju cli for any service.

  This is typically useful as a subordinate to jenkins-slave for

  charmtesting or to turn byobu-classroom into juju-classroom.


  As a standalone charm, this can be useful when experimenting

  with different environments/providers.
