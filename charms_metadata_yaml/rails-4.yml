description: 'Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework in Ruby for writing

  real-world applications.


  Being a full-stack framework means that all layers are built to work

  seamlessly together. That way you don''t repeat yourself and you can

  use a single language from top to bottom. Everything from templates to

  control flow to business logic is written in Ruby.
