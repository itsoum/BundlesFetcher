description: 'Jhbuild is a program that can be used to pull a number of modules from

  Git, CVS, Subversion, Bazaar and other types of repositories or from

  tarballs and build them in the correct order.  Unlike some build

  scripts, jhbuild lets you specify what modules you want built and it

  will then go and build those modules plus dependencies.  Although

  jhbuild was originally developed to build GNOME, it has since been

  extended to work with other projects as well. Extending it to handle

  new modules is usually trivial assuming the build infrastructure

  matches the other modules it handles.

  .

  This charm deploys jhbuild and setup the environment for automated

  building and testing of gnome or any other collection of source packages.
