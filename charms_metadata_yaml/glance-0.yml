description: 'The Glance project provides an image registration and discovery service

  and an image delivery service. These services are used in conjunction

  by Nova to deliver images from object stores, such as OpenStack''s Swift

  service, to Nova''s compute nodes. This forked version overwrites the pg_num variable

  in the ceph osd provisioning by reducing it to a sane level.
