description: 'Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,

  /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans

  failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban

  allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to

  ban an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a

  notification email.  By default, it comes with filter expressions for

  various services (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but

  configuration can be easily extended for monitoring any other text

  file.  All filters and actions are given in the config files, thus

  fail2ban can be adopted to be used with a variety of files and

  firewalls.
