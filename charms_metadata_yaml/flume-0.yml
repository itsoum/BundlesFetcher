description: "Fast\nA single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads\
  \ and writes per \nsecond from thousands of clients.\n\nScalable\nKafka is designed\
  \ to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data \nbackbone for a large\
  \ organization. It can be elastically and transparently \nexpanded without downtime.\
  \ Data streams are partitioned and spread over a \ncluster of machines to allow\
  \ data streams larger than the capability of any \nsingle machine and to allow clusters\
  \ of co-ordinated consumers\n\nDurable\nMessages are persisted on disk and replicated\
  \ within the cluster to prevent \ndata loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of\
  \ messages without performance \nimpact.\n\nDistributed by Design\nKafka has a modern\
  \ cluster-centric design that offers strong durability and \nfault-tolerance guarantees.\n"
