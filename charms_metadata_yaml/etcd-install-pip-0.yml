  discovery. etcd is inspired by Apache ZooKeeper and doozer, with a\nfocus on being:\n\
  \n Simple: curl'able user facing API (HTTP+JSON)\n Secure: optional SSL client cert\
  \ authentication\n Fast: benchmarked 1000s of writes/s per instance\n Reliable:\
  \ properly distributed using Raft\n\netcd is written in Go and uses the Raft consensus\
  \ algorithm to\nmanage a highly-available replicated log.\n"
