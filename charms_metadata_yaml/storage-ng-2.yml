description: 'Generic storage charm subordinate.  Intended to aid in making charms

  easier to interface with external storage solutions without having

  to speak and understand each type.  Presents a single mount point on

  the unit, and communicates that back to your service through the data

  relation.

  This charm is a fork of storage, and is a total rewrite in python to make

  unit testing and quality easier to enforce.
