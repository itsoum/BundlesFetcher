description: 'TeamSpeak is a quality, scalable application which enables people to

  speak with one another over the Internet. TeamSpeak consists of both

  client and server software. The server acts as a host to multiple

  client connections, capable of handling literally thousands of

  simultaneous users. This results in an Internet based teleconferencing

  solution that works in a variety of applications such as team mates

  speaking with one another while playing their favorite online game,

  small businesses cutting costs on long distance charges, or for

  personal communication with friends and family.  This package contains

  the server daemon.
