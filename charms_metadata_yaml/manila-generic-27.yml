description: 'The Manil share file system service provides a set of services for management

  of shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud environment. The service

  resembles OpenStack block-based storage management from the OpenStack Block

  Storage service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can create

  a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then read

  and write data from your instances to and from your file system.


  The manila-generic plugin (using the manila-plugin relation) provides the

  configuration information to the manila charm to configure the Manila

  instance such that it can use the generic driver appropriately.
