description: 'The CharmScaler is an autoscaler for Juju applications. Based on Elastisys''

  autoscaling engine, it rightsizes your application deployments using

  sophisticated auto-scaling algorithms to ensure that the application runs

  cost-efficiently and is responsive at all times, even in the face of sudden

  load spikes. At times of high anticipated load your charm is reinforced with

  additional units -- units that are automatically decomissioned as the

  pressure on your application goes down.
